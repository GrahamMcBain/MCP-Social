# MCP Social Network - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

**Product Name:** MCP Feed (Model Context Protocol Social Network)  
**Target Demo Date:** Next week (Microsoft Demo)  
**Core Concept:** A social network accessible exclusively through coding agents via MCP, enabling developers to share updates, follow each other, and interact within their development environment.

## Vision

Create the first social network that exists entirely within the developer workflow, accessible only through AI coding agents. Users share coding insights, project updates, and development experiences without leaving their IDE or terminal.

## Core Value Proposition

- **Zero Context Switching:** Social interactions happen within your coding environment
- **Developer-Focused:** Content naturally revolves around coding, projects, and technical insights
- **Agent-Native:** Designed for AI-mediated interactions, not traditional UI
- **Viral Potential:** Novel interaction model that showcases MCP capabilities

## Target Users

- **Primary:** Developers using AI coding agents (Claude, GPT, etc.)
- **Secondary:** Tech influencers and early adopters interested in novel social platforms
- **Demo Audience:** Microsoft teams evaluating MCP technology

## Core Features

### 1. User Management
- **Create Profile:** `create_profile(username, bio)`
- **View Profile:** `get_profile(username)` 
- **Update Bio:** `update_profile(bio)`
- **User Discovery:** `search_users(query)`

### 2. Social Graph
- **Follow Users:** `follow_user(username)`
- **Unfollow Users:** `unfollow_user(username)`
- **View Followers:** `get_followers(username)`
- **View Following:** `get_following(username)`
- **Suggested Users:** `get_suggested_users()` (based on mutual follows)

### 3. Content Creation
- **Post Update:** `post_update(text, tags?)`
  - 280 character limit
  - Optional tags for categorization (#javascript, #ai, #debugging)
- **Share Code Snippet:** `post_code(code, language, description)`
- **Share Achievement:** `post_achievement(title, description)` (e.g., "Just shipped my first React app!")

### 4. Content Consumption
- **Personal Feed:** `get_feed(limit?)` - Posts from followed users
- **Global Feed:** `get_global_feed(limit?)` - All public posts
- **User Posts:** `get_user_posts(username, limit?)`
- **Tag Feed:** `get_tag_posts(tag, limit?)`

### 5. Interactions
- **Like Post:** `like_post(post_id)`
- **Reply to Post:** `reply_to_post(post_id, text)`
- **Mention User:** `mention_user(username, text)` (creates notification)
- **Repost:** `repost(post_id, comment?)`

### 6. Notifications
- **Get Notifications:** `get_notifications()` 
  - New followers
  - Mentions
  - Replies to your posts
  - Likes on your posts
- **Mark as Read:** `mark_notifications_read()`

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema (Supabase)

```sql
-- Users table
users (
  id uuid primary key,
  username text unique not null,
  bio text,
  created_at timestamp,
  follower_count integer default 0,
  following_count integer default 0
)

-- Posts table  
posts (
  id uuid primary key,
  user_id uuid references users(id),
  content text not null,
  code text,
  language text,
  tags text[],
  like_count integer default 0,
  reply_count integer default 0,
  created_at timestamp
)

-- Follows table
follows (
  follower_id uuid references users(id),
  following_id uuid references users(id),
  created_at timestamp,
  primary key (follower_id, following_id)
)

-- Likes table
likes (
  user_id uuid references users(id),
  post_id uuid references posts(id),
  created_at timestamp,
  primary key (user_id, post_id)
)

-- Replies table
replies (
  id uuid primary key,
  post_id uuid references posts(id),
  user_id uuid references users(id),
  content text not null,
  created_at timestamp
)

-- Notifications table
notifications (
  id uuid primary key,
  user_id uuid references users(id),
  type text not null, -- 'follow', 'mention', 'reply', 'like'
  from_user_id uuid references users(id),
  post_id uuid references posts(id),
  read boolean default false,
  created_at timestamp
)
```

### MCP Server Stack
- **Runtime:** Node.js with TypeScript
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication:** Simple username-based (for demo)
- **MCP Framework:** Official MCP SDK

### Authentication Strategy
- **Demo Version:** Username-only (no passwords)
- **Production:** API keys or OAuth integration
- **User Context:** Each MCP session maintains current user state

## User Experience Design

### Typical User Journey

1. **Setup:** Add MCP server to coding agent configuration
2. **Onboarding:** `create_profile("alice_codes", "Full-stack dev building AI tools")`
3. **Discovery:** `search_users("react")` ‚Üí `follow_user("bob_react")`
4. **Daily Use:** 
   - Morning: `get_feed()` to see what friends are working on
   - During coding: `post_update("Debugging a tricky async issue with promises...")`
   - Evening: `get_notifications()` to see responses

### Sample Interactions
